# Data-Structure-Course

This repository contains materials for the **Data Structure** course taught at the [University College of Technology](https://www.collegeoftechnology.edu.bd/), where I am currently working as a **part-time lecturer**.

This repository contains all course materials, including **lecture slides** and **PDF resources**, intended for students enrolled in the Data Structure course. The course content primarily follows the **Schaum's Outline Series: Data Structures** textbook, with supplemental materials and practical insights provided throughout the semester.
